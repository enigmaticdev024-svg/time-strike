T-Strike is a fast-paced, reaction-based web game where precision is everything. Your goal? Stop the timer exactly at a randomly generated target time (e.g., _5.00 seconds_). Simple? Yes. Easy? Not at all.

Developed using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this project showcases fundamental frontend development skills and is ready to deploy on Vercel (or GitHub Pages).  
It was also originally created as part of a high school computer science project.

## Features

### Gameplay

- A random target time is displayed at the start of each round.
- Press Start (or Spacebar) to begin the timer.
- Press again to stop as close to the target as possible.
- Scoring is based on accuracy, with custom feedback messages (_Perfect_, _Good job_, _Missed_, etc.).
- Difficulty increases as you improve:
  - Faster timer
  - Tighter error margins
  - Visual distractions

### Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Page structure
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, theming
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling
- **Vercel**: Static hosting (no build step)

## Deploy on Vercel

This is a static site (`index.html` at the repo root). `vercel.json` tells Vercel to skip install/build and publish the project root.

### Dashboard

1. Push this repo to GitHub (or GitLab / Bitbucket).
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository.
3. Leave Framework Preset as **Other** (or rely on `vercel.json`).
4. Click **Deploy**.

### CLI

```bash
npx vercel
```

For production:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Local preview (optional):

```bash
npx serve .
```
